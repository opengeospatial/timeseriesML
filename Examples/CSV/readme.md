# Examples of TSML CSV encoding

Following the work of the [W3C CSV on the Web Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page.html), additional metadata is provided in an accompanying JSON file.

From https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-tabular-metadata-20151217/#introduction : A human consumer of this data might be able to figure out the meaning of the different columns in Example_1_CSV, particularly if there were some additional human-readable documentation made available. Automated processors would have a much harder time; realistically they would be limited to displaying the information in a table. Making available machine-readable metadata in an accompanying JSON file helps with the interpretation of the tabular data. 

Same simple sea surface temperature example as used for the [CovJSON examples](https://github.com/opengeospatial/timeseriesML/blob/master/Examples/CovJSON/readme.md) as CSV file with accompanying JSON metadata.
