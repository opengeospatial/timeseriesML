This file is for listing Version 2.0 Requirements and Recommendations

1) Discuss and figure out the repercussion on TimeseriesML implementations as edits occur to the following International abstract models 
   ISO 19123 (Schema for Coverages) and ISO 19156 (Observations and Measurements).
   
      -"Concerns of some OGC members with ISO 19123/19156 conceptual models causing problems with implementations (CIS1.1). Since ISO 
        are editing 19123/19156 at present, concerned that implementation level feedback (CIS1.1) into this editing process are not being 
        well communicated. This feedback is what OGC would like to contribute."
   
2) Look for discrepancies between the O&M/TimeSeriesML and the WCS/Coverage approach: including changes implied by W3C development of SSN 
   (semantics sensor network) and SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/)

3) Consider the Observational / Coverage relationship for any mis-alignment and redundancies (focus of Charlotte, NC, Dec 2018 OGC TC 
   TSML SWG)
   
4) Communicate and Disseminate the more complex Timeseries Use Cases (NASA’s), both outside and inside OGC, to gauge their need across 
   other domains. If there is more interest outside of NASA, there will be more push to incorporate these use case's requirements into 
   future versions of TimeseriesML. Moreover, there was a motion in the Timeseries SWG meeting in Singapore, March 2019, to "decipher whether 
   any of NASA’s Use Case Requirements are duplicated or shared among other disciplines." 
   
   Within OGC, look at:
      -Moving Features
      -SWE Common
      -look into WaterML's work since WaterML split from TimeseriesML
   
   Some of the requirements from the use cases are:
      -Multiple elements per time step
      -Divorcing TSML Metadata from Data Payload
      -Relaxing Sampling Features with Fixed Locations Requirement
      
5) Consider the development of a Timeseries Profile of CIS1.1 (update, as it stands now, from GMLcov 1.0). The TimeseriesML abstract model 
   (15-043) conforms to ISO 19123 (Schema for Coverages) but not CIS1.1. the concrete implementation. 

6) Consider the development of a JSON Encoding to go along with the XML Encoding (15-042r5)
   -JSON, as a format, may handle multiple elements per time step more easily.
