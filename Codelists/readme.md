Within TSML, we have 5 codelists:
- InterpolationType, more details in the [wiki](https://github.com/opengeospatial/timeseriesML/wiki/Interpolation-Types)
- DataQuality (OK, except for Concepts being in all Schemes)
- ObservationType
- ProcessType
- TimeseriesType

Unfortunately, there are issues in these lists, some codes are missing, others misspelled (e.g. TotalPrec was listed under PrecTotal). 
Concepts are assigned to many wrong concepts schemes (example on [AvePrec](https://defs.opengis.net/prez/catalogs/ogc-cat:datamodels/col/datamodels:timeseriesml/it1/observationtype:timeseriesML/it2/interpolationcode:AveragePrec))
